BEHIND THE SCENES: what I’ve learned
Welcome to Behind the Scenes, where I will line-by-line explain what was going through my head as I wrote a poem.
We’re starting with “what I’ve learned,” which can be found on my Instagram @wordsbykailey, but also here:

if there’s anything that university has taught me, it is this:

I am average.

and I wonder when average became an insult,
when did extraordinary become the standard,
and if we are all extraordinary, then aren’t we all average?

you don’t need to placate me,
I know where I stand.
in the gap between soaring and sinking,
I exist,
floating on the surface,
resting on the line

and I’m okay with that.
No, I’m not settling –
in the rat race of human life, we start and end in the same place

but you know, average is a place of privilege –
I am finding my balance on the tightrope of normal,
have my feet on either side of the boundary line,
my arms are just wide enough to touch greatness
and know humility

will you let me reclaim this word for what it is,
will you let me be content with who I am,
and what I offer to this world –
with all the greatness and weakness of being average,
here I am

First, I begin with:
if there’s anything that university has taught me, it is this:

I am average.

I wrote this poem at the beginning of my second year of university. I remember struggling with the anonymity of university in that first year. I didn’t really know how to make friends. I grew up in a school of three hundred kids – about 70 kids in my graduating class, and many of them I’d known since elementary. It was easy to stand out in that kind of environment, but on a campus of forty thousand people, I was reminded that I was a little fish in a big pond.
and I wonder when average became an insult,
when did extraordinary become the standard,
and if we are all extraordinary, then aren’t we all average?
This is a question that I’m asking myself, really. Why did I want to be the “best” in the class? My motivation wasn’t intrinsic or noble or anything. I was playing a comparison game – whether it was about how busy I was or my grade average. University made me realize that I was never going to be the best at anything, that not everyone is meant to be extraordinary, but why did that matter anyway?
you don’t need to placate me,
I know where I stand.
in the gap between soaring and sinking,
I exist,
floating on the surface,
resting on the line

and I’m okay with that.
No, I’m not settling –
in the rat race of human life, we start and end in the same place

I wanted it to be clear in my poem that I wasn’t asking for sympathy. I want people going like, “Oh no, Kailey, you’re actually really great at \_\_\_.” The point of the poem is to show that – like most people – I’m quite ordinary. I used the imagery of a line because I wanted to evoke the image of graphs, because they’re usually a tool used to measure and compare, especially for grades. There’s also the image of a body of water; I think I was always someone that coasted through life.
“No, I’m not settling –” is a line that makes me wonder if I was just trying to make excuses for my lack of ambition. Am I settling? I don’t know. But we all start and end in the same place – nothingness and death. Even if life is uneven and stacked unfairly, we’re all human; the point is that no measurement or comparison or worth ascribed to someone matters at the end of the day.
but you know, average is a place of privilege –
I am finding my balance on the tightrope of normal,
have my feet on either side of the boundary line,
my arms are just wide enough to touch greatness
and know humility

I take on a more nuanced meaning of average. More than just average in terms of typical or ordinary, an average represents a set of unequal values. Being average, I’m capable of greatness and weakness all at once and it keeps me humble. If you were to quantify my skills and abilities, you’d find that there are strengths, but also plenty of room for improvement.
will you let me reclaim this word for what it is,
will you let me be content with who I am,
and what I offer to this world –
with all the greatness and weakness of being average,
here I am

Maybe I’m addressing myself here. Maybe I’m talking to all the people that tried to put me on a pedestal or put me down. “will you let me be content with who I am” is one of the most important lines in this, even though it’s not really that emphasized. I struggle a lot with trying to reach someone else’s expectations for me, but I realize now that maybe I am enough sometimes. Nothing more, nothing less.
I was surprised at the reaction to this poem. I didn’t expect people to relate so much. But I think at the heart of this poem, it’s a question of self-worth. People took “average” to mean that you’re worth less, but I tried to rebrand the word and reshape it into something admirable. And it is, really. We’re all capable of extraordinary things and we all have great weaknesses – it all averages out.
