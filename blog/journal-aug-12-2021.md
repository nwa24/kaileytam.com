So there I am, sitting half-naked in my underwear with my toothbrush still in my mouth, when I first begin to cry. I proceed to rinse my mouth, sit on the edge of my bed, and stare blankly at the wall for the next ten minutes.

My laptop is behind me, yet to have been opened, even though it's already late in the morning. The to-do list grows longer and longer.

Instead of completing my readings (readings I'd already pushed off for the past week) or working on my essay edits, I decide to journal instead. Because I swear to God, if I look at my goddamn Google Calendar one more time, I'm going to scream. Or cry. Or both.

That reminds me, I have to reschedule a work commitment. More than one. Another few people I'll be disappointing.

Why am I so bad at saying no? I just want someone to blame. I guess that's not fair to say.

How did I get here? Crying again. I knew I shouldn't have brought up work. I always do this.

I am so deeply unhappy.

Or perhaps the better word for it is *fragile*.

One more thing and I'm going to snap. Is it too late to say no? I am in so much pain. Friendships, work, school--it's all slipping through my fingers.

Anyone? Anyone? *God?* Are you there? Can you see me? I get it if you don't want to. I don't want to. I want to disappear so badly. 

Who the hell said journaling was supposed to help? I'm crying even more now. I don't have the time for this.

When I cry, I usually cry without sound. I don't even dare to sniffle. But now my breaths are coming out in desperate gasps--do I *want* someone to hear me?
