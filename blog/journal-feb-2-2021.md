**For me, identity is fluctuating, changing, overlapping, multiple.** For some reason, we really like labelling people, categorizing them to fit all-too-small boxes in our all-too-small minds. I'm guilty of this. It's easier to think of someone as an irredeemable, unchanging, unforgivable son-of-a-bitch rather than someone capable of contradiction, complexity, growth*—*someonejust like me. It's easy to pick out one facet of someone's identity and generalize the rest*—*for better, but usually for worse.

What do I identify as? As I list these out, I have a sense of fear within me*—*will I be overdetermined, essentialized, boiled down to a few words that may or may not change in the future? Will these words immortalize me as something that I eventually grow away from?

Right now, I identify as an Asian woman of Chinese descent, a writer, a poet, a student, a settler on stolen lands, mostly heterosexual, largely influenced by Christianity. I have to use qualifiers because sweeping categories don't seem to fit anymore. Words like *heterosexual* suggest a binary (one that's false) and words like *settler* and *Christian* are fraught with complicated histories that I don't have the time to go into in this particular entry. *Christian* in particular suggests values that I don't necessarily agree with, but have to acknowledge in order to prevent the same violent cycles of colonialism, imperialism, racism, misogyny. Even as I try to demarcate the lines that intersect in my identity, half of those signifiers feel like old clothes that fit*—*but not quite anymore. They're loose in some places, tighter in others, the colour is fainter than it was a few years ago.

The last few years of my life has felt like trying to zip up my high school prom dress. The zipper slides smoothly up and up until it snags right at my waistline. I can suck in my stomach, contort my body this way and that, but at the end of it all, I just end up a little sweaty, a little disappointed, and a little demoralized.

**It feels like impostor syndrome to try and belong in the same places I used to belong.** For much of my life, maybe even now still, I have been set on a pedestal, an example for my peers. I was given a mic and a voice and a pen. I was told which words to say and I was praised when I said them. I can't deny the privilege that has brought me, the doors that has opened, the trust I've been bestowed. But I'd be lying if I said it hadn't also crippled my self-esteem, given me a severe case of perfectionism, and made me doubt everything I've ever learned.

My identities were given to me*—*I was lauded for having the right ones. And now, at twenty, I'm attempting to deconstruct the identities I have, the identities (and institutions) I'm shedding. I want to give myself the space to reform and reshape and remake.

In Genesis, it says we were created in the image of God*—*and it's a little problematic to take a verse meant to describe the nation of ancient Israel out of its context*—*but if I was made in the image of a Creator, shouldn't I also have the power to recreate my identities?

Growing up, I was told that my identity is that of a child of God, that my identity is who God says I am. However, I don't see why or how it can't overlap with other identities (like being queer, or being politically left-wing, or being a woman). If the God of the Judeo-Christian tradition can be so complicated as to exceed the boundaries of human imagination, why shouldn't human identities be just as complex?

The idea that my identity is simply given to me by the divine, that being a child of God obscures and supersedes all my other identities, doesn't sit right with me anymore. Can it really be that simple? I believe identity is crafted relationally*—*sure, we must create identity for ourselves, but we have to get our language, and therefore our constructions of identity, from somewhere. If identity is crafted in a dialectic, in a wrestling (one of the most overused words in some Christian traditions), then being simply who God says I am doesn't seem like enough anymore. I don't think God would hand over the answer to my identity crisis that easily anyway.

**I'm a product of the attitudes, values, and beliefs of my family, my education(s), my friends, the church I grew up in, and what I've chosen to accept and reject from these institutions.** Human identity shifts and expands*—*Abram is renamed Abraham, Jacob is renamed Israel, Sarai is renamed Sarah, Saul is renamed Paul. And even though God does a lot of the renaming, it was always in the context of wrestling, transformation, the willingness to go and believe.

I don't know how willing I am right now to go and believe. But I am willing to transform. And maybe with each transformation, I am getting closer to a self that will fit. Maybe I'll never get there. Maybe the bounds of identity were always supposed to be a mirage, as concrete as shifting sands*—*but I am learning to be okay with the fact that I don't fit in the same boxes I used to.

Some of my jeans have gotten tighter since the beginning of quarantine. My high school prom dress hangs in my closet*—*I'll probably never fit into it again. But if I can learn to love how I've changed*—*physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually*—*maybe that's enough.

We are in a constant dialectic. The clothes that fit today might not fit tomorrow. But at these scenes of metamorphosis, at the points of collapse, I think I might be finding God again. I think I might be finding myself.

And there is something profoundly hopeful, profoundly beautiful about this unending process. My best friend, Fyonna, loves thrift-shopping precisely because of the feeling she gets when she finds that one-of-a-kind item that, against all odds, fits perfectly. And because I can shift, because I can change, I can have those moments too. 

So until the next thrift find,

Kailey.
