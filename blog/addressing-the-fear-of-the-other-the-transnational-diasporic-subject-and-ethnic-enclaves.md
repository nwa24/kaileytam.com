title: "Addressing the Fear of the Other: The Transnational Diasporic Subject
  and Ethnic Enclaves"
---
**Among the influx of immigrants to Canada,** almost 70% of immigrants between 2001 and 2006 chose the major urban areas of Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto as their preferred destination. Particularly, in the Metro Vancouver area, the immigrant population in Richmond and Surrey has increased quickly in the last two decades (Teixeira, 2014). Based largely on the 2016 Census, the City of Richmond released demographic data sheets in 2019, noting that 60.2% of Richmond residents are immigrants (“Immigration Hot Facts,” 2019) while over half of Richmond residents are ethnically Chinese (“Ethnicity Hot Facts,” 2019). The translocation of immigrants creates new forms of identity and citizenship, as globalization transforms the relationship between the immigrant’s place of residence and their cultural activity, identity, and experiences (Shizha, 2014). Immigrants maintain their cultural identities by creating ethnic enclaves within their host societies to receive support from their community. The tension between integration and maintaining one’s cultural identity is inherent in the experience of a transnational migrant, but ethnic enclaves may be a means of resistance to the pressures of financial need, discrimination, and cultural assimilation. However, these ethnic enclaves can often be perceived with fear by their host societies (Sandercock, 2009), especially as language and socioeconomic differences further the distinction between Self (the host society) and Other (the immigrant). Using Richmond, B.C. as a case study, this essay argues for the importance and necessity of ethnic enclaves and that addressing this fear of the Other does not necessitate the dismantling of ethnic enclaves, but rather requires opportunities for dialogue and interaction between people within and outside of the ethnic enclaves.

**Chinese and Taiwanese food stalls line the sides of the Richmond Public Market (RPM),** each with its own sign of English and Chinese characters. Below are produce markets, clothing stores, and a singular bookstore, with titles all in Chinese. The RPM is a unique hub of activity, a community all on its own, providing the belonginess integral to “an individual’s social safety net and sense of identity” (Shizha, 2014). Transnationalism has no universal definition, but it is useful to approximate one for the purposes of this essay. Transnationalism attempts to describe the complex connection that immigrants have to their homelands, even as they integrate into their host societies. Two societies—home and host—are brought together in a single space, just like the RPM. Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Mandarin inflect this singular space, making visible the transnational connections of home and away. Spaces such as the RPM resist what Routledge calls the politics of forgetting, in which a place is rendered forgettable and vulnerable groups are displaced as “emergent moral and aesthetic evaluations about suitably ‘national’ or ‘global’ land use have rendered them ‘out of place’” (2010). The RPM, with its affordable food options and marketplace, is a microcosm of the larger ethnic enclave in Richmond, providing for support for ethnically Chinese immigrants as they integrate into Vancouver, while maintaining their distinct cultural identities.

**In Richmond, new apartment and office buildings multiply along No. 3 Road,** driving up housing prices that immigrants often cannot afford to pay alone. Teixeira notes that recent immigrants and refugees often face challenges in their settlement and housing experiences beyond monetary costs. Many of them are “at risk of exclusion, marginalisation, poverty, or even homelessness” (Teixeira, 2014). These risks are compounded by “economic disadvantages; limited employment opportunities; high housing costs; language barriers; discriminatory practices by landlords, neighbours, and others; as well as a lock of knowledge about the functioning of the housing market and access to housing services and programs” (Teixeira, 2014). Ethnic enclaves become a coping mechanism for the struggles of immigration; participants in Teixeira’s study often emphasized the importance of staying in contact with their family and ethnic networks who helped them with finding housing and employment (2014). Many Chinese immigrants in Richmond that participated in the study said that they shared accommodations on arrival as an alternative to unregulated renting, unsafe and poor-quality housing, and discriminatory housing practices. Ethnic enclaves, then, are a means of resisting structural inequalities that would discriminate against racialized immigrants in housing and employment opportunities.

**However, these ethnic enclaves are frequently met with fear and suspicion.** Chinese signage, some only in Chinese, proliferates in Richmond (as seen above), but one interviewee in the National Post calls Chinese-only signs “un-Canadian.” Two Richmond residents appeared in front of the Richmond City Council to demand legislation that would force local businesses to advertise in one of Canada’s official languages, saying that “we, the new visible minorities, are experiencing exclusion” (Hopper, 2014). The fear of a Chinese takeover has historically existed in Canada since the first few Chinese immigrants landed in British Columbia. Chinatowns were created to stymy the “Chinese threat” and this perception of threat and suspicion toward ethnic enclaves remains as “strangers entering the urban fabric in significant numbers…can be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as undermining a particular way of life” (Sandercock, 2009). The unfamiliarity of Chinese language signs could potentially stoke the fear of the Other; notably, the National Post article specifies that many of their interviewees are long-time Richmond residents that have watched the proliferation of Chinese people and language in the city.

Although some argue that ethnic enclaves are resistance to acculturation and Canadianization (or the process of becoming Canadian, and therefore integrating into Canada), Shizha notes that “cultural maintenance is closely linked to identity maintenance” (2019). Integrationists, although well-meaning, can “place the burden of achieving integrationist policy objectives squarely on the back of minority groups” (Goetz, 2018), overlooking the importance of ethnic enclaves in a transnational migrant’s transition into their host society. Despite the popular myth that ethnic enclaves “breed and promote segregation and social exclusion” (Shizha, 2014), ethnic enclaves provide a shield for new immigrants from loneliness and cultural shock, allowing them the support to integrate into their new host societies.

**Many businesses in Richmond offer English language lessons,** including Mingde College in the above photo. Advertised largely in Chinese, these language services target Chinese immigrants that must learn English to seek employment opportunities. For immigrants that neither have the time nor the money to learn a new language, ethnic enclaves become social networks that allow their participation in the labour market, as they can access employment opportunities through interpersonal connections (Shizha, 2014). For example, the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (SUCCESS), founded in 1973 by Chinese immigrants, provides services for Chinese immigrants, including “English language training, career counselling, and job referral services” (Sandercock & Brock, 2009). Although SUCCESS began as an organization dedicated to bridge Chinese immigrants and Vancouver’s social service agencies, SUCCESS evolved into a large immigrant organization that offers services and language programs to other, non-Chinese immigrant groups, becoming a significant component of Vancouver’s immigrant services (Sandercock & Brock, 2009). SUCCESS demonstrates how multicultural policies do not encourage the “ghetto-izing” of ethnocultural communities, but rather allow for the servicing of many ethnocultural communities in Vancouver (Sandercock & Brock, 2009). Ethnic enclaves, likewise, become a platform for immigrants to become acculturated to their host societies, allowing them to better integrate into the fabric of Vancouver and to become active urban citizens that participate in the political life of the city (Routledge, 2010).

**What are the planning implications then for the City of Richmond?** How should the city address this fear of the Other and prevent the planning system from becoming “an outlet for the deep-seated fears, aversions, or anxieties of some residents” (Sandercock, 2000)? Sandercock (2000) argues for a *therapeutic* approach when addressing the fear of the Other:

> a dialogical approach (as would occur in psychoanalysis) which brings antagonistic parties together to talk through their concerns. This requires an open and communicative planning process, involving negotiation and mediation in working through a problem with those directly affected. It requires life experience, communicative skills and, in multicultural or multi-ethnic contexts, cross-cultural understanding. (p. 23)

Rather than coercively attempting to dismantle ethnic enclaves and limit housing opportunities for new low-income immigrants of colour, urban and racial equity necessitates intersectional discussion that acknowledges the value of ethnic enclaves (Goetz, 2018). Organizations like SUCCESS provide a positive example for integration that uses collaborative and community programs to integrate Chinese, and then non-Chinese, immigrants into Vancouver (Sandercock & Brock, 2009). City planners must reject the definition of integration that requires assimilation, but rather acknowledge and plan for the existence and multiplicities of difference through the immigrant services the city provides. Furthermore, the city must create opportunities for dialogue to bridge the gap of understanding between residents of Richmond, acknowledging and dismantling the fears and the myths surrounding ethnic enclaves. Rather than using legislation to coerce integration, city planners must use a multi-pronged, community-oriented approach that addresses not only the perception of fear towards Chinese immigrants, but also the discriminatory practices regarding employment and housing and the need for more immigration and language services. Storytelling, listening, and translation must become our main tools in navigating cultural differences and understanding the transnational diasporic experience and ethnic enclaves (Sandercock, 2000), so that we can better address the concerns of the host society and the struggles of immigrants in Canada.
