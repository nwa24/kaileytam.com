**I keep dreaming of you**. White sheets and a glass window. The late afternoon sun seeps into the room and we wear nothing but each other. 

The dream always starts here. In bed. You tuck my hair behind my ear. "Your morning breath is atrocious," I say. We kiss anyway.

The dream shifts. Sometimes it shifts to foggy bathroom mirrors and fighting for counterspace. Sometimes the scene moves to the kitchen, where we move in synchronized chaos. "Where's the milk?" "Pass me a fork." "Get it yourself." 

Always, there is music playing.

We walk on city streets, fingers interlaced. I try to ignore the stares of passersby. I shrink into the coat I stole from your side of the closet. I try to be brave.

I don't meet your eyes when I slip my hand out of yours. 

I will apologize later when the blinds are down, under the canopy of our bedsheets. 

You tell me you understand, but your eyes are hollow. 

I pretend I don't hear you when you ask to meet my family. Pull away when you try to kiss me in the park. I pretend not to see how you wilt, how you begin to lose your vibrancy. I pretend that I am not the one stealing it away. I pretend that our four walls are a sanctuary and not a prison.

The dream always ends in the same way: an open door, an empty hallway, a sad smile. "I love you." "That's not enough anymore." "I'm sorry." "I know."

There are two mugs drying in the dishrack. Two reading chairs in the living room. Two indentations in our*â€”my* bed. I try not to think how the rooms feel emptier, how I feel smaller. 

I shrink into the coat I stole from your side of the closet. I try to be brave. I try to run after you, but the dream always ends the same.
