The design process was difficult to say the least. I mentioned [last post](https://www.kaileytam.com/blog/the-making-of-on-the-way-home) about how Fyonna and I began with a mood board on Pinterest. The first thing Fyonna asked me as we started talking about the book was, “What words come to mind when you think about what your book is going to look like?”

The ideas I had originally were “soft” or “relaxed”—I imagined a lot of blues and yellows, pastel colours. I didn’t even have a title yet so it was hard to assemble a vibe for our book. I think the working title for our Google doc was like “driving somewhere…idk whatever.”

When we first started assembling our Pinterest board, it was a lot of neutral colours.

<br/>

I don’t know what it is about neutral colours that are so attractive to me, but pretty much everything I own and wear are neutral colours. Eventually, the style shifted to include more colour. We started to look at chalk and oil pastels as styles we wanted to include in the book.

<br/>

If you have the book, you’ll know that it doesn’t look anything like our Pinterest board. But it was a good starting point.

This is the base layer for a spread at the end of chapter one (“baby steps away from home”):

<br/>

These two poems mark the end of the first chapter and the shift of mood to one that’s more foreboding. “anticipation” especially shows that mood shift, as if the book is anticipating the storm that’s coming in the next chapter. Since the imagery throughout these two poems involve overcast skies, rain, and clouds, I knew I wanted the visual to reflect and accompany the words.

The first iteration of the spread kind of reminded us of _Toy Story_ clouds:

<br/>

Since the “clouds hang low,” we thought it’d be cute to have the clouds look like they’re actually hanging. The shift in mood is reflected by the shift in clouds—from sunny to rainy to storming.

As Fyonna illustrated other poems, she realized there was a slight difference. In the image above, the clouds have shading. But for some of the other poems, they were mainly line drawings. This is reflected in the second iteration:

<img src="/assets/clouds-hang-v3.jpg" width="800" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%"/>

<br/>

After this shift, we realized that still other poems had a different style. There was too much empty space in our spreads. We decided to fill that space using blobs of colour:

<br/>

We soon realized, however, that the style of drawing was too “childish” for the rest of the book, especially as the poetry matures. The colours were varying too much throughout the book, and as cute as these clouds were, they didn’t match the rest of the book. Each illustration was cute on its own but when you flipped through (or I guess, scrolled through) the book, it just wasn’t coming together.

It was probably late April or early May when we hit this creative block. We weren’t sure if the page colouring was right, if the style of illustrations were too cute or too childish, if we should decide on a colour palette or not.

So then, we began exploring other designers’ work. This led to a little rabbit hole of comparison, but in the end, we decided that a colour palette was the way to go. We were stuck between two colour palettes: blue and red or green and red. Blue and red seemed to be overdone, so we went with the green. This is our colour palette that we gave Nicole, who engineered this whole site:

<br/>

And finally, we arrived at our final iteration:

<img src="/assets/clouds-hang-v5.jpg" width="800" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%"/>

<br/>

The amount of care and thought that go into this whole process is kind of crazy as I reflect back on it. We were so proud and so excited to see it all finally come together, grounded in colour, style, meaning, and words.
