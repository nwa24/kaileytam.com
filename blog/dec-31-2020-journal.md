**Good night to one of the shittiest years in recent history.** Good night to a year's worth of trauma, to the culmination of powerful people making selfish decisions. Good night to the consequences of hate and bigotry and xenophobia and racism and sexism.

The constraints we've put on time might be telling us that it's a new year, but we should know better. The number on our clocks and calendars has changed to account for another all-too-arbitrary trip around the sun, but the consequences will continue into January.

I don't know why I decided to start journaling. I was flipping through some old notebooks and thoughts*—*most of them quite embarrassing, but I digress. The past nine months under quarantine conditions have changed me, as I'm sure the next nine months will continue to do so. I suppose this will be a log of my progress*—*if there is any. 

Here's where we end the year and begin the next: I feel quite hopeless. Quite insignificant. As I'm sure most (or many) people do right now. I feel abandoned by the God I worshipped, and maybe that's why I feel as if I've abandoned the community I worshipped in. The cracks have made themselves apparent in most of my close relationships; like the rest of the shit that's happened this year, it's been a long time coming.

I'm sitting at my desk*—*the same desk I've been spending eighty percent of my waking hours in*—*undressed, face and skin routine half-done, hair pulled back in some embarrassingly greasy mess. My hand is cramping. And so, I will ask the same question I have been asking all year: *what the fuck am I doing here?*

**It's raining quite hard outside.** I can hear it on the roof, trickling down the pipes, splattering on the windows and balcony. I suppose that will hopefully discourage the partiers from setting off fireworks and hosting illegal gatherings amidst a fucking pandemic. 

I sound like Ebenezer Scrooge.

Anyway. I want to feel hopeful. I really do. I want to stop wallowing in self-pity, but still give myself the space to breathe. And maybe even cry. I want to run away and start anew. I want to create a sanctuary in a broken church. I want to tear institutions down, brick by brick. I want to witness a revolution and rebuild. I want to sleep easy at night again, for my jaw to relax the tension my body refuses to let go of. I'm tired.

How many journal entries do I have to write before something hopeful occurs? What do I hold onto in the midst of the waiting? God, where did you go? I have been asking for you for the past five, six years, and every time I think I have found you, you disappear. Were you ever there?

Why is it that every time I pray, I revert to a frightened child, lost in the woods? I suppose that's what I am in the eyes of the church*—*a lost sheep unable to think for herself. I want to trust my body again.

To the future me reading this again: I hope you are in a better place than you are now. That your trajectory remains forward. That you are looking forward to something. Anything.

Maybe that's why I don't give a damn about New Year's. What is there to celebrate? We can make all the resolutions we want, but come December, we realize nothing happened the way we planned. We can say and pretend that's a good thing, but we continue to grieve anyway.

Here's to another year of crumbling foundations*—*from the brokenness in our political, religious, school institutions to the end of the fucking world. (Big corporations and global warming*—an absolute bitch*). Here's to all the books I said I would read but never did. Here's to all the pounds I wanted to lose but never will. Here's to all the friends I never made and all the friends that I have lost. Here's a big fuck you to the universe or to whatever god(s) and most of all, to myself.

Please be doing better, future-me. And stop being so goddamn dramatic.
